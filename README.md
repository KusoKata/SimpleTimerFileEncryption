# Simple Timer File Encryption - Hide your files from yourself!
What is the use of this file encryption?

For example:

Time lock - By capturing a safe's combination lock in a photo, you can obscure the code until a future moment when it's unveiled.

Deferred messages - Letters can be frozen in time through photography, with their contents remaining a mystery until a predetermined future occasion.
